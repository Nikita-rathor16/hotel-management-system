          <p>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. 
            Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to 
            large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, 
            upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may 
            offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. 
            Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business 
            centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, 
            tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are 
            usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room.
